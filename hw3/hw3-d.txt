The SQLServer is very efficient in terms of executing complex data manipulation. However, I would not recommend it for a fellow student due to its complicated set up and importing data. But I would definitely recommend it to future co-workers for their project because SQLServer can collect and store serveral database. Since it is a cloud-hosted DBMS, multiple people can have access to the database at the same time and work collaboratively.
